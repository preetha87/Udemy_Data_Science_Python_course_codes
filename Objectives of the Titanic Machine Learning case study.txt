Objectives of the Titanic Case Study

1. To make predictions on the test data set in terms of which passengers are likely to Survive the sinking and which passengers are not.

2. To carry out steps in Exploratory Data Analysis such as missing value imputation and the conversion of categorical variables into numeric variables and 

3. To carry out steps pertaining to Feature Engineering

4. To make use of three types of Machine Learning algorithms - Logistic Regression and Ensemble techniques such as Random Forests and    Gradient Boostingand calculate the accuracy score for these algorithms utilizing K-Fold cross validation and make predictions on the test set utilizing all three algorithms and thereby try and draw conclusions as to which algorithm is more advtangeous than the other.
